any particular role but often end up dealing with too many application that are 
time consuming and delays the recruitment process. Providing recruiters with the

  specification

  previous works
* A visual appealing, well functioning site
* A site with the functionality to download a pdf format of the candidate's CV
* A site with well defined contact details that can be used to contact the 
  candidate.

### Developer and Business Goals

  history, work experience, skill sets, and previous milestone projects
* Create a positive visual appealing and navigation experience for recruiters
* To make this milestone1 project as part of my portfolio.

  2. A form that can be used to contact the candidate
  3. An email confirmation sent when a contact form is submitted, in order to 
     confirm that the contact form submission was successfull.
  4. Well arranged and easy to read text, so that i can have proper 
     understanding of the content.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one that is designed for recruiters to easily 
source and identify the best candidate to hire. 
The following design choices were made with this in mind:

#### Fonts

   1. The primary font "Exo" was chosen because it's convey a technological/
      futuistic feeling while keeping an elegant design. Exo is a contemporary 
      geometric sans-serif typeface and it has 9 weights.
   2. the second font "Roboto" was chosen because it comes in a large variety of 
      weights for maximizing options on texual layout and establishing an 
      efective visual hierarchy. The font demonstrate humanistic qualities 
      through the use of rounded letterforms and a strong calligraphic shapes 
      which makes it easy to read both on screen and in printed materials.

#### Icons

* All icons used were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose, so that they 
  can be understood by everyone.

#### Colours

#### Styling

#### Backgroung
