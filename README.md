  previous works

  candidate.

  history, work experience, skill sets, and previous milestone projects

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one that is designed for recruiters to easily 
source and identify the best candidate to hire. 
The following design choices were made with this in mind:

#### Fonts

   1. The primary font "Exo" was chosen because it's convey a technological/
      futuistic feeling while keeping an elegant design. Exo is a contemporary 
      geometric sans-serif typeface and it has 9 weights.
   2. the second font "Roboto" was chosen because it comes in a large variety of 
      weights for maximizing options on texual layout and establishing an 
      efective visual hierarchy. The font demonstrate humanistic qualities 
      through the use of rounded letterforms and a strong calligraphic shapes 
      which makes it easy to read both on screen and in printed materials.

#### Icons

* All icons used were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose, so that they 
  can be understood by everyone.

#### Colours

#### Styling

#### Backgroung
